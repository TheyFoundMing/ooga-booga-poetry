      This is a Neanderthal poetry clone made for fun during my free time. This
      clone has no affiliation whatsoever with the original Neanderthal Poetry
      game nor Exploding Kittens. If you like the game, maybe buy the
      <a

        actual board game as well</a
      >!
    </div>
    <div class="desc">
      To start the game, you can join a game from the game's room ID listed on
      the top right corner of the screen - otherwise, you can also create a new
      one! You can choose to use the suggested player name or create your own.

      This is not meant to be played in silence but rather in-person (or a Zoom
      call!) as there wouldn't be any other way to communicate with the other
      players otherwise. Hopefully in the future I could implement a voice
      channel feature which may help!
